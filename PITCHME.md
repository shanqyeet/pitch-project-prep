# Waterfall vs. Agile 

+++ 

 ~**Waterfall**~

One Project Lifecycle 

Requirement Engineering >> Planning >> Development >> Testing >> Deployment 

+++

 ~**Waterfall**~

* Meet client at the beginning and when the project is due for delivery 
* Does not require client participation 
* Risk is low 

+++ 

<-**Agile**-> 

```
waterfall.reverse()
```

*not really*

+++ 

<-**Agile**-> 

feature 1 
plan >> develop >> test >> deploy 

feature 2 
plan >> develop >> test >> deploy

+++ 

<-**Agile**-> 

Core Idea: Actively Engages Stakeholders and allow for flexible changes of the requirement through the project 

Risk: Medium  -> scope creep
